# Agroforest Cooperation Lens (ACL)

*A shareable, engineering-style template to design, observe, debug, and iteratively improve a food-producing forest by maximizing beneficial relationships.*

---

## 0) Define success like an engineer (SLOs + constraints)

**Project name:**
**Location + climate notes:**
**Time horizon:** 1 yr / 3 yr / 7 yr / 15 yr
**Primary outputs (ranked):** (fruit, nuts, greens, tubers, timber, fodder, medicine, honey, etc.)
**Constraints:** water availability, labor hours/week, budget, slope/erosion risk, wildlife pressure, legal/invasive constraints.

### SLOs (pick 5–10 you’ll actually track)

* Food yield (kg or baskets per season) by crop type
* Survival rate (%) of plantings after dry season / winter
* Soil cover (% ground covered year-round)
* Infiltration / ponding (qualitative + simple timed test)
* Soil organic matter trend (if you test) or proxy: earthworms/crumb structure
* Pollinator activity (counts per 5 min on key bloom days)
* Pest damage (leaf area loss categories)
* Labor input (hours/week)
* Water use (irrigation hours or liters/week)
* Canopy closure progression (shade % at noon in summer)

---

## 1) Model the system as 4 flows (your “cooperation map”)

Every design decision should improve at least one flow without breaking another.

### A) Energy (light → biomass → food)

* Canopy architecture, stratification, seasonal light windows, successional plan.

### B) Water (rain/irrigation → infiltration → storage → transpiration)

* Contour, mulch, soil structure, shade, windbreaks, drought buffers.

### C) Nutrients (mineral → plant → litter → decomposers → plant)

* Continuous organic inputs, deep-rooted nutrient cyclers, minimal bare soil, minimal disturbance.

### D) Information (signals, timing, biodiversity)

* Flowering calendars, predator/prey balance, microbial partners, “indicator species” and symptoms.

**Deliverable:** draw a simple map with arrows for these 4 flows for each zone.

---

## 2) Site baseline (one-time, then yearly)

**Zones/patches:** divide your site into repeatable units (e.g., Zone A1…A6).

For each zone, record:

* **Topography:** slope %, aspect, frost pockets, wind corridors
* **Water behavior:** where it runs, pools, stays green longest, dries first
* **Soil:** texture (sand/loam/clay feel), compaction, smell, visible life, drainage notes
* **Existing biology:** volunteers/weeds (often excellent indicators), trees, fungi/mushrooms, insects
* **Microclimates:** shade lines, heat islands, reflective walls, humid corners

**Baseline photos:** same 3 camera angles per zone, repeated every season.

---

## 3) Design in “guilds” (functional groups), not single species

### Your guild building blocks (use 1–2 from each)

1. **Primary producers (your food crops):** canopy + understory + shrub + herb
2. **Soil builders:** high-biomass “chop & drop”, living mulches, groundcovers
3. **N-fixers:** trees/shrubs/herbs suited to your region
4. **Nutrient cyclers:** deep-rooted plants that pull up minerals; heavy mulchers
5. **Pollinator support:** long-bloom sequence across seasons
6. **Predator support:** habitat + nectar for beneficial insects; perches; refuge
7. **Water managers:** dense mulch producers, shade providers, windbreaks
8. **Barrier/decoy:** sacrificial/trap plants where appropriate; thorny edges if needed

### Guild rule-of-thumb (resilience through redundancy)

* **At least 3 species per stratum** in a zone (where feasible)
* **At least 2 different functions** supporting each main crop (e.g., a pollinator plant + a soil builder)

**Guild card (fill this out for each key planting cluster):**

* **Guild name:**
* **Main crop(s):**
* **Support species by function:** (soil builder, N-fixer, pollinator, predator support, etc.)
* **Spatial layout:** distances, sun/shade expectations, root competition notes
* **Water plan:** establishment irrigation + long-term target
* **Maintenance:** pruning, chop schedule, mulch sources
* **Failure modes to watch:** (pests, shade, waterlogging, nutrient lockup, etc.)

---

## 4) Establishment strategy (succession + risk management)

### Succession plan (what wins when)

* **Year 0–2:** build soil + shade/wind structure; fast biomass; protect young trees
* **Year 2–5:** diversify perennials; start serious yields; tune spacing via pruning
* **Year 5+:** canopy management, understory refinement, stable nutrient cycling

### Risk controls (make the system tolerant to mistakes)

* Plant in **waves** (Version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2) rather than all-at-once
* Keep **multipliers**: nursery area, cuttings, backup seedlings
* Design **access paths** early (maintenance is the hidden constraint)
* Prefer **reversible interventions** first (mulch, shade cloth, pruning) over irreversible ones

---

## 5) Observability: your weekly “field dashboard”

Pick 10 minutes per zone, once a week in season.

### Record the same minimal set (fast + consistent)

* **Plant vigor:** 1–5 score (color, turgor, new growth)
* **Soil cover:** % covered + bare spots location
* **Moisture:** finger test depth + notes on cracking/ponding
* **Pests:** what + where + severity (0 none / 1 light / 2 moderate / 3 heavy)
* **Beneficials:** pollinators seen, predators/parasitoids seen
* **Phenology:** flowering/fruiting stage
* **Actions taken:** pruning/mulch/irrigation/planting
* **One photo** per zone (same angle)

**Rule:** if you can’t measure it simply, define a proxy you can measure weekly.

## 6) Debugging playbook (symptom → hypothesis → test → fix)

Use this order: **Light → Water → Soil/Roots → Nutrients → Biotic (pests/disease)**

### A) Plant looks weak / slow growth

**Hypotheses**

* Too much shade or too much sun/heat
* Under/over watering or poor infiltration
* Compaction / poor root oxygen
* Nutrient access issue (often water/roots first)

**Quick tests**

* Noon light check + seasonal expectation
* Dig a small inspection hole: root depth, smell (anaerobic?), soil structure
* Check drainage after irrigation/rain (does it stay wet too long?)

**Fixes (start reversible)**

* Adjust canopy (prune/thin), add temporary shade or wind protection
* Increase mulch + living cover; reduce bare soil
* Aerate with broadfork (if appropriate), add organic matter, reduce traffic
* Improve water capture/infiltration (contour, basins, slow-spread-sink)

### B) Yellowing leaves (chlorosis)

**Triage**

* **Old leaves first:** often mobile nutrient shortage or root/water stress
* **New leaves first:** often micronutrient access or root issues

**Quick tests**

* Soil moisture + drainage
* Compare affected plant vs neighbors (pattern matters)
* Consider pH or salts if chronic + widespread

**Fixes**

* Solve water/root oxygen first
* Add diverse organic inputs (compost + mulch), not just single-nutrient fixes
* Foliar feeds can be a short-term bridge, but treat root cause

### C) Pest outbreak

**Hypotheses**

* Plant is stressed (water/light/roots) → pests become “symptom amplifiers”
* Predator habitat missing
* Too much of one crop in one patch (low diversity)
* Ants protecting sap-suckers, etc.

**Quick tests**

* Look for predators (lady beetles, lacewings, wasps, spiders)
* Check if damage is localized near an edge/host plant
* Inspect undersides of leaves, new growth tips

**Fixes**

* Reduce stress (often the main lever)
* Add flowering support (staggered blooms), refuges, mulch complexity
* Prune heavily infested tips; use targeted controls only if necessary
* Increase diversity / break up monoculture patches

### D) Fungal disease

**Hypotheses**

* Poor airflow, persistent leaf wetness, overcrowding
* Too much nitrogen flush (tender growth)
* Susceptible varieties in wrong microclimate

**Quick tests**

* Morning leaf wetness duration
* Can you see through the canopy (airflow)?
* Is irrigation wetting leaves late in day?

**Fixes**

* Prune for airflow; widen spacing via canopy management
* Water early; avoid wetting foliage where possible
* Increase soil health; select resistant varieties over time

### E) Low fruit set

**Hypotheses**

* Pollinator mismatch / lack of bloom overlap
* Temperature/chill/heat issues at flowering
* Water stress during bloom or fruit set
* Nutrient imbalance

**Quick tests**

* Pollinator counts during bloom (5-minute observation)
* Look at weather during bloom window
* Compare zones (microclimate effect)

**Fixes**

* Extend bloom season with support plants
* Provide habitat and water for pollinators
* Stabilize moisture around bloom; mulch + irrigation timing

---

## 7) Cooperation boosters (high ROI interventions)

* **Keep soil covered** (mulch + living cover) year-round
* **Keep living roots** as much as possible (perennial groundcovers, rotations)
* **Continuous organic inputs** (chop-and-drop, compost, leaf litter capture)
* **Stack flowers through time** (early/mid/late season nectar sources)
* **Create predator structure** (hedgerows, refuges, perches, logs/rocks)
* **Design for access** (paths, pruning height, harvest ergonomics)
* **Plant for redundancy** (backup species for each function)

---

## 8) The improvement loop (how to “ship” versions of your forest)

Run this like a product cycle every season:

1. **Observe:** dashboard + photos
2. **Diagnose:** pick top 1–3 constraints by zone
3. **Hypothesize:** “If we increase X, Y improves because…”
4. **Experiment:** small A/B change (one zone or strip)
5. **Measure:** compare to control area
6. **Standardize:** roll out what works
7. **Document:** update guild cards + zone notes

---

## 9) Shareable format (so others can reuse your system)

**Minimum share pack:**

* 1-page site map (zones + water flow)
* Guild cards (one per cluster)
* Seasonal dashboard template + example entries
* “Top 10 failure modes” you encountered + fixes that worked
* A photo timeline per zone (same angles)

**Data model suggestion (simple):**

* Zone → Guilds → Species → Events (plant/prune/mulch/irrigate) → Metrics (scores + photos)

---

## 10) Your first deliverables (do these next)

1. Create zones + baseline photos
2. Write SLOs + constraints
3. Build 3 guild cards (one sun, one partial shade, one edge/wind zone)
4. Start weekly dashboard logs for 4 weeks
5. Pick one high-ROI constraint and run a small experiment
